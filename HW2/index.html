<h2>Ghastly Shooter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
In this 3rd person point of view 2D shoot 'em up game where you are allowed to move in 9 different directions compared to just the normal left and right. 
The game uniquely featuresitems like the blue plus that powers up your blaster to shoot 3 bullets at a time and the heart medkit that increases your health.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game is able to create multiple items that uniquely intereact with other items within the game. 
The enemies in the game have ean AI that can go off screen and go back on screen. 
The game features an in-game restart feature after you win or lose to replay the game.
The bullets are deleted when they reach the border of the screen.
The game is able to keep track of multiple variables such as the amount of health the player has and the amount of points they have.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What I learned from this prototype is how to manipulate groups to move together and how to make power ups that change what ability the player has.

The hardest part in making this prototype was making the items such as power ups and have their effect trigger and turning off the power up effects after the game ended or restarted.

I made some assets but also borrowed assets from the following sources.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<li>
The game that most closely resembles my game and that I also borrowed code from is:
<ul>
<li>Example game on phaser.io: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/invaders">Invaders</a></li>

<li>I also borrowed code and assets from the Phaser 2 tutorial: <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game/index">Phaser Code and Assets</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is a 3rd person point of view 2D shoot 'em up flight game where you play as Booboo the ghost to fly around and shoot bullets at a different invading ghost group who are lost and stumbled on your home to invade and take for themselves.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The storymatic themes I used are 1. ghost, 2. person who is lost (ghosts in this game), and 3. flight.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For input, I used keyboard, mouse, and direct in this prototype. For randomness, I used deterministic for this prototype. For genre I used shooter, 3rd person point of view, and shoot 'em up in this prototype. For playstyle I used achiever and performer for this prototype. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics that this protype is evaluating are 9 dirrectional player movement, object to object interations, adding power up effects, how to turn off power up effects, giving the player the special ability in the form of being able to shoot a bullet, enemy AI, item functions, animated background visuals, and sound effects for specific events.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel cautious when they move the character to dodge enemy attacks. 
I want the player to feel accomplished when they defeat enemies. 
I want the player to feel more confident and stronger when they get an item such as a power up. 
I want the player to feel like they want to play the game when they lose by having a fast in-game restart feature.

</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

Take as much time as possible killing enemies because there is no timer. 
Avoid dying at all to get the highest amount of points possible because dying takes away some points.
