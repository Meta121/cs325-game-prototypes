<h2>Bobo's Treasure Adventure</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game features stars as obstacles and traps for the player to traverse along with the platforms of the game in order to reach the goal of the diamond treasure stash. The player can move left, right, and jump and also uniquely fast fall downwards by pressing the down arrow key.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game can play music, play sound effects, create a background, create platforms for the level, create the player character with various movement options, create obstacles, and create rewards in just one screan.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What I learned from this prototype is how to create a character and give it movement options, change the background, add music, add sound effects, create objects that interact with other objects in the game, work with the physics of objects, and keep how to keep track of how many points the player has.
The easiest part of making the protype was remaking the platform sprite.
The hardest part of making the prototype was getting other example game codes to work correctly when first initially copied and changing it because changing something else effected another thing in the code.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<li><strong>Sources -</strong>
I had to borrow the Phaser 2 tutorial code because I couldn't get example code to work?

</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

<li>
The game that most closely resembles my game and that I also borrowed code from is:
<ul>
<li>Example game on phaser.io: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/scalemanager/full-screen-game">Full Screen Game</a></li>

<li>I borrowed code and assets from the Phaser 2 tutorial: <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game/index">Phaser Code and Assets/a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal the of the game is for the player to maneuver through platforms and obstacles to get as many points as possible by collecting as many diamonds as they can while avoiding stars that decrease the amount of points the player has and kills the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The story is told through the atmosphere and appearance of the game. The game takes place in a desert planet where the player treasure hunter Bobo must avoid stars and maneuver through the planet to collect diamonds to gain points for money.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this prototype I used the keyboard as the input device, random number generator to generate some sort of randomness, and the playstyle of a 2D platformer for this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics that this protype is evaluating are player movement, object to object interations, platform arrangement, item functions, background visuals, usage of a background theme, and sound effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>

I want the player to enjoy move the character around and to feel good when they are able to platform through obstacles and get diamonds as rewards to increase the amount of points they have. On the otherhand, I want the player to feel bad when they touch stars and lose points so that they will avoid the stars better.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

</li>
<ul>
<li> 
Press the up arrow key to make Bobo jump. 
Press the left arrow key to move Bobo left.
Press the right arrow key to move Bobo right.
Press the down arrow key to make Bobo fast fall downwards.
The following are the Core Mechanics of the game.
The player has to maneuver through platforms.
The player has to avoid touching stars that will kill them and take away points while they are maneuvering through the level.
The player has to touch diamonds to increase the point count.
</li>

</ul>
<li>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<li>Jump over stars to maneuver around the level without touching any stars.</li>
<li>Avoid going to areas that have stars in them and do not have diamonds.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>

The world of Bobo's Treasure Adventure takes place on a desert like planet Desock with a great supply of diamonds that the treasure hunter Bobo wants to take for himself to get points and make money.
Treasure hunter Bobo is a famous treasure hunter who has gone to many planets to harvest treasure from to earn a profit.
The planet Desock is a rocky and desert planet that has low gravity which causes pieces of rock to float and hover in the air.
Due to the planet Desock's low gravity, Bobo can jump higher and faster than he could on a planet like Earth.
The game world and occupants are uniqueue because the lower gravity of the planet and Bobo's alien heritage allows for gameplay with higher jumps and faster movement than normal platformer games that feature regular humans.
The dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension by making the primary goal of the player character Bobo what the player wants to do in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic Bobo's Treasure Adventure is trying to reach is everyone but prioritizing kids who would like to play a simple 2D platformer game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game can take up to 20 seconds to play.
</li>
